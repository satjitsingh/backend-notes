## 1. Regions

### What is it?
A Region is a physical location in the world where AWS has data centers.
Each Region is completely independent. Example: `us-east-1` (Virginia), `ap-south-1` (Mumbai).
AWS has 30+ Regions globally. You choose where your resources live.

### Why it matters in production
- Region choice affects **latency** (closer to users = faster).
- Region choice affects **compliance** (some data must stay in certain countries).
- Region choice affects **cost** (pricing varies by Region).
- Region choice affects **service availability** (not all services exist in all Regions).

### Core Ideas
- Each Region has **at least 3 Availability Zones**.
- Regions are **isolated** from each other — a failure in one doesn't affect others.
- Data does **NOT** automatically replicate across Regions (you must set that up).
- Pick Region based on: latency, compliance, cost, available services.
- **`us-east-1`** (N. Virginia) is the default and has the most services.

### Quick Analogy
Region = A city where AWS has built a campus of data centers.
Mumbai is one campus. Virginia is another. They don't share anything by default.

### Architecture View
```
AWS Cloud
├── Region: us-east-1 (Virginia)
│   ├── AZ: us-east-1a
│   ├── AZ: us-east-1b
│   └── AZ: us-east-1c
├── Region: ap-south-1 (Mumbai)
│   ├── AZ: ap-south-1a
│   ├── AZ: ap-south-1b
│   └── AZ: ap-south-1c
└── Region: eu-west-1 (Ireland)
    ├── AZ: eu-west-1a
    ├── AZ: eu-west-1b
    └── AZ: eu-west-1c
```

### Hands-On (Step-by-step Lab)
1. Log in to AWS Console.
2. Click the **Region dropdown** (top-right corner).
3. Switch between `us-east-1` and `ap-south-1`.
4. Go to EC2 → Notice instances are Region-specific (different list per Region).
5. Go to **AWS Regional Services List** page → See which services are available where.
6. Launch an EC2 in Mumbai → Check latency from India vs from the US.

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Deploying everything in `us-east-1` without thinking about user location.
- ❌ Assuming resources created in one Region are visible in another.
- ❌ Forgetting that S3 bucket names are global, but data is regional.
- ❌ Not checking if the service you need exists in your chosen Region.

### Pro Tips
- ✅ For Indian users → use `ap-south-1` (Mumbai).
- ✅ For global apps → use multiple Regions + Route 53 for DNS-based routing.
- ✅ Always mention Region strategy in interviews: "We picked the Region closest to our users for low latency, and ensured compliance."
- ✅ Some services are **Global** (not Region-specific): IAM, Route 53, CloudFront, WAF.

## 2. Availability Zones (AZs)

### What is it?
An Availability Zone is one or more physical data centers within a Region.
Each AZ has independent power, cooling, and networking.
AZs within a Region are connected by **high-speed, low-latency** private links.

### Why it matters in production
- AZs are the foundation of **high availability** on AWS.
- If one AZ goes down (fire, power outage), your app still runs in another AZ.
- **Every production system should use at least 2 AZs.**

### Core Ideas
- Each Region has **at least 3 AZs** (some have 6).
- AZs are **physically separated** — different buildings, different flood zones.
- AZs are named like `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`, etc.
- **AZ mapping is account-specific** — `us-east-1a` in your account may be a different physical AZ than in another account (AWS randomizes to balance load).
- Use **AZ IDs** (like `use1-az1`) for exact identification across accounts.

### Quick Analogy
Region = A city.
AZ = Different neighborhoods in that city.
If one neighborhood floods, the others are fine. But they're close enough to communicate fast.

### Architecture View
```
Region: us-east-1
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                             │
│  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  │
│  │  AZ-1a   │  │  AZ-1b   │  │  AZ-1c   │  │
│  │ ┌──────┐ │  │ ┌──────┐ │  │ ┌──────┐ │  │
│  │ │ EC2  │ │  │ │ EC2  │ │  │ │ EC2  │ │  │
│  │ │ RDS  │ │  │ │ RDS  │ │  │ │  -   │ │  │
│  │ └──────┘ │  │ └──────┘ │  │ └──────┘ │  │
│  └──────────┘  └──────────┘  └──────────┘  │
│       ◄──── High-speed private links ────►  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Hands-On (Step-by-step Lab)
1. Go to **EC2 → Launch Instance**.
2. In Networking settings → Notice the **Subnet** dropdown shows AZs.
3. Launch one instance in `us-east-1a` and one in `us-east-1b`.
4. Both instances can talk to each other privately (same VPC).
5. Go to **RDS** → Create a database with **Multi-AZ** enabled.
6. Observe: RDS creates a primary in one AZ and a standby replica in another.

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Putting all resources in a single AZ — single point of failure.
- ❌ Confusing AZs with Regions — AZs are INSIDE a Region.
- ❌ Assuming AZ names map the same across AWS accounts.
- ❌ Not enabling Multi-AZ for databases in production.

### Pro Tips
- ✅ Always deploy across **at least 2 AZs** for production workloads.
- ✅ Use **Auto Scaling Groups** spanning multiple AZs.
- ✅ Use **Application Load Balancer** — it distributes traffic across AZs.
- ✅ In interviews, say: "We deploy across multiple AZs for fault tolerance. If one AZ fails, the load balancer routes to healthy instances in other AZs."

## 3. Edge Locations

### What is it?
Edge Locations are small AWS data centers spread all over the world.
They are used to **cache content closer to users** for faster delivery.
AWS has **400+ Edge Locations** — many more than Regions.

### Why it matters in production
- Edge Locations power **CloudFront** (CDN) and **Route 53** (DNS).
- They reduce latency for end users by serving content from nearby.
- Without Edge Locations, a user in Tokyo would wait for data from Virginia.

### Core Ideas
- **CloudFront** caches static files (images, CSS, JS, videos) at Edge Locations.
- **Route 53** resolves DNS queries from the nearest Edge Location.
- **AWS Global Accelerator** uses Edge Locations to optimize routing.
- **Lambda@Edge** lets you run code at Edge Locations (e.g., A/B testing, auth).
- Edge Locations are **NOT** the same as Regions or AZs.
- Content at edges has a **TTL** (Time to Live) — it expires and refreshes from origin.

### Quick Analogy
Region = A warehouse (stores all products).
Edge Location = A local delivery hub (keeps popular items nearby for fast delivery).
User orders → Gets item from nearest hub, not from the far-away warehouse.

### Architecture View
```
User in Tokyo
      │
      ▼
Edge Location (Tokyo) ── Cache HIT? ──▶ Return content (fast! ~10ms)
      │
      ▼ (Cache MISS)
Origin Server (S3 in us-east-1) ──▶ Fetch, cache at edge, return to user
```

### Hands-On (Step-by-step Lab)
1. Upload a file to **S3** in `us-east-1`.
2. Create a **CloudFront Distribution** → Set S3 as the origin.
3. Access the file via the CloudFront URL.
4. First request: Slow (fetches from S3).
5. Second request: Fast (served from Edge Location cache).
6. Use browser DevTools → Compare load times.

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Confusing Edge Locations with AZs — they serve different purposes.
- ❌ Setting TTL too high — users see stale content.
- ❌ Setting TTL too low — too many requests hit origin, defeating the purpose.
- ❌ Not invalidating CloudFront cache after deploying new static files.

### Pro Tips
- ✅ Use CloudFront for ALL static content in production — images, CSS, JS.
- ✅ Invalidate cache after deployment: `aws cloudfront create-invalidation`.
- ✅ Use **Origin Access Control (OAC)** to restrict direct S3 access.
- ✅ In interviews: "We use CloudFront to cache static assets at Edge Locations to reduce latency globally."

## 4. High Availability Basics

### What is it?
High Availability (HA) means your system stays running even when parts fail.
The goal: **minimize downtime**. Ideally, zero downtime.
AWS gives you the building blocks. You must architect for HA — it's not automatic.

### Why it matters in production
- Downtime = lost revenue, angry users, SLA violations.
- AWS guarantees infrastructure uptime, but YOUR app's HA is YOUR responsibility.
- Every DevOps interview asks: "How do you ensure high availability?"

### Core Ideas
- **Multi-AZ** — Deploy across 2+ AZs. If one dies, the other takes over.
- **Load Balancing** — Distribute traffic across healthy instances (ALB/NLB).
- **Auto Scaling** — Replace failed instances automatically. Scale with demand.
- **Health Checks** — ALB and Route 53 check if targets are healthy.
- **Multi-Region** — For extreme HA. Active-Active or Active-Passive across Regions.
- **RDS Multi-AZ** — Automatic failover for databases.
- **S3** — 99.999999999% durability (11 nines). Automatically spread across AZs.
- **SLA** — Service Level Agreement. AWS guarantees uptime (e.g., EC2 = 99.99%).

### Quick Analogy
HA = Having a backup goalkeeper on the bench.
If the main goalkeeper gets injured, the backup jumps in immediately. The game continues.

        Auto Scaling: launching replacement...
```

### Hands-On (Step-by-step Lab)
1. Launch 2 EC2 instances in **different AZs**.
2. Install a simple web server (Apache/Nginx) on both.
3. Create an **Application Load Balancer** → Add both instances as targets.
4. Access the ALB DNS → See traffic going to both instances.
5. **Stop one instance** → ALB automatically routes all traffic to the healthy one.
6. Create an **Auto Scaling Group** (min: 2, max: 4) → It replaces the stopped instance.

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Running a single EC2 with no backup — single point of failure.
- ❌ Using only one AZ — defeats the purpose.
- ❌ No health checks configured — ALB sends traffic to dead instances.
- ❌ Confusing durability with availability (S3 is durable, your app on it may not be available).
- ❌ Thinking HA is automatic — YOU must design for it.

### Pro Tips
- ✅ **Minimum production setup:** ALB + 2 EC2s in 2 AZs + Auto Scaling Group.
- ✅ Use **RDS Multi-AZ** for database HA (automatic failover).
- ✅ Use **Route 53 health checks** for multi-Region failover.
- ✅ Design for failure: "Everything fails, all the time" — Werner Vogels (AWS CTO).
- ✅ In interviews: "We ensure HA using Multi-AZ deployments, load balancers, auto scaling, and health checks. For critical systems, we add multi-Region failover with Route 53."
